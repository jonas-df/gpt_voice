# Voice Chat GPT

Voice chat GPT is an experiment in integrating a local voice to text tool
(whisper), with groq's API for fast querying of LLMs and Elven Labs text to
voice API. The tool is designed to record audio through the microphone, save
it as a WAV file, transcribe it locally and send a request to groqâ€™s api that
in turn returns an answer.

## Dependencies

The application has the following python dependencies that can be installed
with pip:

```bash
pip install pyaudio watchdog pynput groq openai-whisper python-dotenv pygame
```

In addition it is required to install the portaudio library that pyaudio
depends on as well as ffmpeg

```bash
sudo apt install portaudio19-dev ffmpeg
```

You also need to keep a .env file with your environment variables which in this
case is your groq API key. And if you want to use Elven labs your elven labs
API key.

```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY="<your-groq-api-key>"
```

## Features

- **Audio Recording**: Start and stop audio recording using a keyboard shortcut
  (right ctrl) and save it as a WAV file.
- **File Monitoring**: A background daemon monitors for changes to the audio
  file and transcribes it using whisper as soon as it detects any changes.
- **Transcribing using Whisper**: Transcribes the audiofile locally. If the
  model is not yet downloaded whisper
  will download the model for you on first run.
- **Upload to groq API**: Uploads the file to groq. You are able to configure
  what model to use, currently uses the 'base' model, a system message to
  initialise the model and how many of your previous questions you want to
  resend to the model.
  It currently sends the last 5 questions and answers to the model for context.
- **Upload to TTS Service**: Uploads the text reply to Microsofts Edge service
  or to Elven Labs and converts the text to speech using their models.
  Plays the audio file back to the user.
